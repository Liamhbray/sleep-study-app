    start_date DATE NOT NULL,                           -- Required for scheduling
    end_date DATE,                                      -- Set when study completes
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### organization_memberships (formerly staff_memberships)
```sql
-- Links users (staff, doctors, admins) to organizations with role details and permissions
CREATE TABLE organization_memberships (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES app_users(id),
    organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id),
    role_details JSONB NOT NULL,                        -- Position, permissions, etc.
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Key Relationships

CREATE POLICY "Patients can view their own sleep studies" ON sleep_studies FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = patient_id);

-- Patients can create their own bookings
CREATE POLICY "Patients can create their own sleep studies" ON sleep_studies FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = patient_id);
```

#### **Staff Administrative Powers**
```sql
-- Staff can view all studies in their organization
CREATE POLICY "Organization members can view studies in their org" ON sleep_studies FOR SELECT
USING (
    auth.uid() = patient_id OR
    organization_id IN (
        SELECT organization_id FROM organization_memberships WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
);

-- Staff can help patients create and manage studies
CREATE POLICY "Organization members can create studies in their org" ON sleep_studies FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = patient_id OR
    organization_id IN (
        SELECT organization_id FROM organization_memberships WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
);
```

    <div id="loading">Loading studies...</div>
</div>
```

#### **Form Submissions**
```html
<!-- Submit form and replace target content -->
<form hx-post="/htmx/booking/save-step" 
      hx-target="#booking-content"
      hx-swap="innerHTML"
      hx-indicator="#step-loading">
    <!-- Form fields -->
</form>
```

#### **Progress Bar Updates**
```html
<!-- Out-of-band swap for progress indication -->
<div hx-swap-oob="innerHTML:#progress-container">
    <div class="w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-2">

    </div>
</div>
```

#### **Conditional Actions**
```html
<!-- Confirm dialog before action -->
<button hx-post="/htmx/study/123/start" 
        hx-confirm="Start this study?"
        hx-target="#study-status">
    Start Study
</button>
```

#### **Loading Indicators**
```html
<!-- Global loading indicator -->
<div id="loading-indicator" 
     class="htmx-indicator fixed top-4 right-4 bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
    <div class="flex items-center space-x-2">
        <div class="spinner"></div>
        <span>Loading...</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### **Real-time Updates**
```html
<!-- Poll for updates every 30 seconds -->
<div hx-get="/htmx/studies/status" 
     hx-trigger="every 30s"
     hx-target="#studies-list">
    <!-- Studies list content -->
</div>
```

### **Navigation**
```html
<!-- Seamless step navigation -->
<button hx-get="/htmx/booking/step/2" 
        hx-target="#booking-content"
